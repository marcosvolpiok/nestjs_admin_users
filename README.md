*REQUIREMENTS*

A new company needs to address these requirements:
Create a Node API with Typescript.
Connect the Node API to MongoDB using mongoose (desirable models in typescript).
We need to develop three endpoints behind a basic authentication (username and password).
Create a user with name, last name, address, and profile picture (this should be a file).
Retrieve users.
Update user.
Star point: Dockerize MongoDB and the Node API
